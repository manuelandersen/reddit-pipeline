1eh7aux,Which database should I choose for a large database?,"Hello everyone. Currently, I am facing some difficulties in choosing a database. I work at a small company, and we have a project to create a database where molecular biologists can upload data and query other users' data. Due to the nature of molecular biology data, we need a high write throughput (each upload contains about 4 million rows). Therefore, we chose Cassandra because of its fast write speed (tested on our server at 10 million rows / 140s).

However, the current issue is that Cassandra does not have an open-source solution for exporting an API for the frontend to query. If we have to code the backend REST API ourselves, it will be very tiring and time-consuming. I am looking for another database that can do this. I am considering HBase as an alternative solution. Is it really stable? Is there any combo like Directus + Postgres?

1ehbgfl,Is it a good idea to use Polars with Pyspark?,"Hi, I'm starting to dip my toes into the data engineering world and have been working a little with Spark. I see that the polars library is quite popular for speed and had some questions. Is it a good idea to use Polars on Spark or will it interfere with Spark's parallelism?

1ehlg5u,"Will Spark speed up my pipeline, Airflow, BigQuery","Hello thanks for taking the time.

I'm a solo developer for an employer who runs a small agency-- basically him and his industry expertise along with me and one other employee. He's brought me on full time because he wants to build out some data services he can offer to his clients with hopes of being able to move away from the traditional agency people / project hand holding strategy into something more scalable-- basically selling curated datasets and expert analysis with some light consulting on the side.

I'm building everything in GCP and pulling from two data sources. Right now the pipeline is running on airflow pulling data from the first API, storing that raw JSON in GCS, as well as performing some transformations on the data to get it to fit our desired schema for BigQuery, saving the transformed JSON, and then running a batch load operation to put the data into BigQuery. Then a request is built off of that data for the second data source (think ""top ten"" or something like that), and the same process is undergone on the second data source.

The process so far is relatively slow, given the API rate limits but also some slowness in processing. I am wary of over-optimizing or over-engineering since I am a single engineer team, and we have other projects ongoing-- however I am curious if someone can answer as to whether it would make sense to perform the data transformations from the raw JSON to the formatted JSON using Spark. Partly this is because I'm interested in learning Spark for its own sake (using the Python API), so there is that. I have of course consulted ChatGPT but it tends to just tell me some version of what I might want to hear i.e. yes you could speed it up with Spark. But what I really want to ask from the human developer perspective is does it make any sense to do it this way or is this over-engineering or inelegant? I'm ok making a bit of an effort to learn the new skill and jerry-rig it to work with my pipeline, like I said I do selfishly just want to apply the tool so that i can put it on my cv, but is this even a useful application of Spark or would I be better of just learning it on some kind of hobby project?

EDIT: Reading the replies and reflecting, sounds like the answer is ""no"", Spark doesn't really make sense here. The main bottleneck is definitely all of the network-bound operations, and looking back the transformations I'm making are minimal, and I've optimized the code pretty much as well as I can using Python (list comprehension :'-D). To be honest, the best way to speed this up will really just be to increase the worker count in Cloud Composer, still a long way for me to go there. I will however consider using an ELT approach next time for this kind of thing, as that was definitely where my mind was going with thinking of introducing Spark. Ultimately I'm still thinking about a way to gain some experience using Spark without myself having to pay to host PB of data! I was hoping I could make it work for this but I'm sure i'll find some opportunity. Thanks for the feedback everyone.",8,8,nem03,2024-08-01 16:46:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ehlg5u/will_spark_speed_up_my_pipeline_airflow_bigquery/,0.91,False,False,False,False

1eh3rmn,Ideas for this project ,"Hello,

I will be working on a project soon for a marketing agency that generates leads for local businesses and tracks the leads that convert in an Excel sheet. Each business has its own Excel sheet, which they manually update when a customer converts.

The agency has two issues: 

1. Because the leads are updated manually, there are often errors due to minor changes made to the sheet by the companies.

2. The agency wants to scale and will start adding more companies, so this manual process might not be sustainable.

Here's my proposed solution:

1. Create a web application using Flask that will allow the companies to update the database with just a few clicks when clients convert. This will limit the manipulation of the Excel file and reduce manual entry errors.

2. Move from Google Sheets to a more robust database system like MySQL or PostgreSQL with multiple tables to support scalability.

I am looking for more ideas on how to deal with this.

1ehnlry,Anyone experience with AWS SDLF ,"Hi,

I joined a new company as a data engineer (with \~5 years of experience in Data & Software eng.) 2 weeks ago and was immediately introduced to [AWS SDLF v1.x](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-serverless-data-lake-framework) as the central data lake solution (managed an internal cloud team).  Migration to v2 going to happen until start of Q4 this year. Seems like I will be working with it regularly from now on and write pipelines using Glue / Lambda. 

Currently I am trying to understand the core principles and the way it works under the hood. Compared to previous architectures , this AWS serverless service mess is way more complex and very fragmented.
